# usernamemention

**usernamemention** is a Reddit bot that scans all new submissions on the subreddit _r/all_, and looks for any inclusion(s) of Redditors (by means of username). If one or multiple usernames are found, then the bot proceeds to send a PM (private message) to all involved users embedded within the submission's information (title, contents, etc.). The purpose for this bot is to complement the already established username mentioning protocol for comments provided by Reddit inherently.
